# Visualizing Market Signals: A Technical Analysis of S&P 500 Price Trends

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes historical stock price data from the S&P 500 using widely recognized technical indicatorsâ€”**Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**, **Bollinger Bands**, and the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**â€”to extract actionable insights into market trends, volatility, and momentum. The analysis is visualized using Python in Google Colab to enable clarity and real-time interactivity.

Developed with a business-first lens, the goal is not algorithmic trading or model optimization but **executive-level insight generation** that supports portfolio decision-making, risk management, and strategic forecasting.

##  Key Insights

### ðŸ”¹ Trend Confirmation
- **SMA 20 and SMA 50 crossovers** are used to identify medium-term momentum shifts.
- These signals support strategic timing for equity entry and exit points, especially for multi-asset or actively managed portfolios.

### ðŸ”¹ Volatility Monitoring
- **Bollinger Bands** capture dynamic price volatility.
- Bands widen during turbulent periods and contract during stable conditions, providing useful inputs for volatility-aware asset allocation.

### ðŸ”¹ Momentum & Market Sentiment
- **RSI** highlights overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) conditions.
- Useful for detecting potential mean-reversion opportunities or price exhaustion in specific equities.
